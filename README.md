This project presents a practical implementation of an image steganography program using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. The program allows users to encode a secret message into an image and subsequently decode the hidden message from the image. By manipulating the least significant bits of the image's pixel values, the program embeds the message in a way that is imperceptible to human vision. The encoding process converts the secret message into a binary format and modifies the pixel data of the image to embed this binary message. Conversely, the decoding process extracts the binary message from the pixel data and converts it back to the original text  format. This  implementation leverages  the Python programming language and the Pillow  library for image manipulation, providing a simple yet effective tool for secure communication. The program is designed to handle standard image formats and can be extended to accommodate larger messages and different steganographic techniques.
